          I'm a full stack web developer with a background in retail inventory
          management and customer service looking to make a career change. I
          recently earned a certificate in full stack web development from the
          University of Denver, where I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS,
          React.js, and responsive web design. I'm excited to leverage my skills
          as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better
          experiences on the web.
